# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Sales Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of coffee shop sales data using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization. The project aims to address various business problems and provide insights through key performance indicators (KPIs) and detailed visualizations.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze coffee shop sales data to gain valuable insights into business performance. We use SQL for querying data and Power BI for creating interactive visualizations. The analysis includes several KPIs and visualization charts to help understand sales trends and patterns.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Total Sales Analysis: Evaluates overall revenue generated by the coffee shop.
* Total Orders Analysis: Tracks the number of orders placed over time.
* Total Quantity Sold: Monitors the quantity of items sold.
* Month-on-Month Increase: Calculates the percentage increase or decrease in sales, orders, and quantity sold compared to the previous month.

## Visualization Charts
* Calendar Heat Map: Displays total sales by day, with intensity based on sales volume.
* Sales Analysis by Weekdays and Weekends: Compares sales performance between weekdays and weekends.
* Sales Analysis by Store Location: Analyzes total sales by different store locations.
* Daily Sales Analysis: Shows daily sales with an average line for the selected month.
* Sales Analysis by Product Category: Breaks down sales by different product categories.
* Top 10 Products by Sales: Lists the top 10 products based on sales volume.
* Sales Analysis by Days and Hours: Provides insights into sales patterns by day of the week and hour of the day.

## Prerequisites
To get started with this project, you will need:

* SQL Database: For running the provided queries.
* Power BI Desktop: For creating and interacting with the visualizations.
* Sample Sales Data: The data should be in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel) for import into SQL and Power BI.

## Getting Started
### 1. Database Setup
* Import Sample Data: Load the sales data into your SQL database. Create tables and insert sample data as per the schema provided in schema.sql.

* Run SQL Queries: Execute the queries in queries.sql to analyze sales data and generate the KPIs.

### 2. Power BI Visualization
* Import Data: Use data_import.pbix as a Power BI template to connect to your SQL database and import the data.

* Create Visualizations: Follow the Power BI dashboard setup in dashboard.pbix to create interactive charts and reports. The visualizations include:

  * Calendar Heat Map: Create a heat map to visualize sales across days.
  *  Sales by Weekdays and Weekends: Set up a chart comparing sales on weekdays versus weekends.
  * Sales by Store Location: Visualize total sales for each store location.
  * Daily Sales Analysis: Create a line chart with daily sales and an average line.
  * Sales by Product Category: Use a bar or pie chart to display sales by category.
  * Top 10 Products by Sales: Highlight the top 10 products based on sales volume.
  * Sales by Days and Hours: Set up charts to show sales patterns by day and hour.
* Customize Dashboards: Tailor the visualizations to fit your business needs. Power BI allows you to filter, drill down, and interact with your data for deeper insights.

## MySql & DAX
Utilized MySql and DAX to make measures and calculations for Total sales, Total orders, Total quantity sold, Sales analysis by weekdays and weekends, Sales analysis by store location, Daily sales with average line, Sales analysis by product category, Sales analysis by days and hours.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* What are the total sales and sales trends over different time periods?
* How do the total orders and quantity sold vary over time?
* What are the sales patterns on weekdays versus weekends?
* How does sales performance vary across different store locations?
* What are the daily sales trends, and how do they compare to the average sales?
* Which product categories contribute the most to sales?
* Which are the top 10 products by sales?
* How does sales performance vary by days and hours?
